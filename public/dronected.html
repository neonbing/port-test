                    <p>In the secondary research, we found that drones have been largely applied in SAR missions such as delivering essential items to subjects, finding people, giving guidance for ground teams, etc.
                        <br>However, we missed the information of drones’ limitations in SAR missions​, SAR teams’ needs and scenarios where drones are useful or not useful.
                        <br>To fill the information gap, we conducted interviews with 11 SAR team members.</p>

                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p><b>Pilot-Observer communication</b></p>
                    <p>Conclusion: Waypoint-only one-way communication is not enough.
                        <br>Evidence: 3 out of 6 users spontaneously talk to pilots: e.g. “Can you fly closer to those two people?”
                        <br>Solution: Test chatbox and audio-chat with observers and pilots to augment the current waypoint system.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Confusion of the action and workflow</b></p>
                    <p>Conclusion: The opaque design, delayed feedback and unclear notification message lead to users’ confusion.
                        <br>Evidence: "I think I hit the report button twice.... is the report button broken?"
                    <br>Recommendations: Immediate feedback, dedicated notification area, sound feedback, clearer notification text.

                <h2 style="font-weight: 700;">Interaction 2</h2>
                <p>In iteration 2, we add a call function on the website, responsible web design to suit all sizes of devices and add more feedback for actions. In hardware, we upgraded both RGB and thermal camera and an adjustable gimbal. Right now, we are confident enough to let pilots other than our teammates control the drone.</p>
                <h3><b>The next question is, does the drone system expand SAR teams’ abilities and does remote co-pilot mode reduce the cognitive load of the pilots?</b></h3>
                <p>These questions are the key to our solution’s value proposition. To answer that, the only way is to test with SAR teams.</p>
                <p>We recruit 8 pilots from SAR teams and work in pair(one as remote co-pilot to assist and another on-site to control the drone), finishing 5 tests in total. We did an experiment, let on-site pilot try to find the subject alone, with a co-pilot, and alone again to compare the difference with two modes.</p>
                <h4>Results</h4>
                <p><li><p>Our prototype is able to prove the concept in the test level, but needs to improve the functionality to reach the work level.</li>
                    Evidence: One SAR team member: “I’d give your product A+ rate”; On-site pilots think our project is a neat idea and they can foresee the use case in SAR team, but there still some bugs to fix.<br></p>
                <li><p>It’s necessary to split control and monitor tasks for two different people, which validates our idea. Frustration of poor communication between the work mate is the main task load of pilot+observer mode, which means we need to improve on the usability.</li>
                Evidence: “It’s hard to concentrate on keep spotting people for more than30 minutes”  and All on-site pilots and remote co-pilots have over 60 on mental load in NASA-TLX(0-100 scale)<br></p>
                    <li><p>Our camera latency issues are one of the primary problems with the current system.</li>
 Evidence: 7 out of 8 participants (pilots and observers) complain about the latency of the video. And one collaboration test failed because of the lagged video feed.
                <br>Recommendation: Offloading video encoding from the Pi and/or have settings for lower resolution.<br></p>

                <p>1. Always over prepare for the field testing, including battery, backup hardware and cellular data. A scheduled user testing session costs a lot of time and budget.​
                ​
                <br>2. Involving engineers in the design process will help the team be on the same page and bring their perspectives. I invited engineers to participate in interviews, discuss evaluation plans, observe evaluations and analyze research results. They can get the striking and fresh information directly from users and feel the ownership of the research results. I don’t need to spend more effort in convincing them to adopt my ideas.
                ​
                    <br>3. Always research and evaluation while design and development. Whenever we have some uncertain areas or challenges, we will seek out help, either consulting with experts or validating with users. As designers or developers, we always try to defend our work, so it’s necessary to test it with real users. </p>
