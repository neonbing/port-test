                    <p>New technologies such as drones expand search and rescue (SAR)’s ability to locate people, but there are some limitations. We conducted 15 interviews with SAR team members and rescuees who have been rescued before to understand the workflow and dig out pain points.

                <p>We had two rounds of field tests, one with non-SAR participants and another one with SAR pilots and iterated our prototype twice. Here are highlights of what we learned. </p>
                <h5><li>Humans have limited attention and working memory resources, so adding an object detection algorithm is necessary to provide more comprehensive information to assist people. </li></h5>
                <h5><li>Remote co-pilot lack the in-field information to make judgements. Thus, adding radar, drone direction and speed is necessary for them to make better decisions. </li></h5>
                <h5><li>Well trained SAR professionals are able to communicate efficiently, so verbal communication is more suitable for them. </li></h5>
                <p>Other than that, we improved the learnability and efficiency of the system and designed a desktop website for remote co-pilots and a mobile website for on-site pilots.</p>

                        Evidence: One SAR team member: “I’d give your product A+ rate”; On-site pilots think our project is a neat idea and they can foresee the use case in SAR team, but there still some bugs to fix.<br></p>
                    <li><p><mark>It’s necessary to split control and monitor tasks for two different people,</mark> which validates our idea. Frustration of poor communication between the work mate is the main task load of pilot+observer mode, which means we need to improve on the usability.</li>
                    Evidence: “It’s hard to concentrate on keep spotting people for more than30 minutes”  and All on-site pilots and remote co-pilots have over 60 on mental load in NASA-TLX(0-100 scale)<br></p>
                        <li><p><mark>We need to provide the option to downgrade the resolution for less lag because 7 out of 8 participants (pilots and observers) complain about the latency of the video.</mark> And one collaboration test failed because of the video feed. In addition, we can try to offload video encoding from the Pi and/or have settings for lower resolution.</p>

                            <br>We use the Yolo v5 model with a public dataset which is good, but not ideal for drones. We will collect 50,000+ annotated images for training the neural network to increase the accuracy under different weather situations and terrains.
                            <br><mark>2. Research on the optimal threshold and the information display styles of AI
                            </mark><br>There is no end to improving AI performance, so we need to determine the best breakpoint which is useful enough for SAR and also not too hard to get. We will have  a set of experiments to figure out what’s the best error rate and accuracy rate of the algorithms to boost search efficiency and lower cognitive load.

                    <h4 class="mt-5 py-4">Reflection</h4>
                    <p> <mark>1. Focus on the minimum viable product.</mark> <br>It's vital to get the first workable version to test with users so that I will have a clearer image of how users use the product.​
                
                    <br><mark>2. Involving engineers in the design process will help the team be on the same page and bring their perspectives. </mark><br>I invited engineers to participate in interviews, discuss evaluation plans, observe evaluations and analyze research results. They can get the striking and fresh information directly from users and feel the ownership of the research results. I don’t need to spend more effort in convincing them to adopt my ideas.
                
                    <br> <mark>3. Always research and evaluation while design and development. </mark><br>Whenever we have some uncertain areas or challenges, we will seek out help, either consulting with experts or validating with users. As designers or developers, we always try to defend our work, so it’s necessary to test it with real users. </p>
