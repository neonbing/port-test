                    <p>Drones are an increasingly vital tool for search and rescue(SAR), <mark>but they still have serious limitations.</mark> They are error prone and time consuming manual video analysis, limitation by terrain blocking signals and extremely high cost to upgrade.</p>
                    <h5 class="mb-2 mt-5">Solution</h5>
                    <p>Our project seeks to <mark>allow a remote cooperative workflow and crowdsourced upgrades for existing search and rescue drones using the high-bandwidth of 5G networks.</mark> The solution includes a website allows more than more eyes to monitor the drone video feed without location limitation and reduce on-site pilot’s cognitive load along with cloud AI algorithm and an add-on module that is compatible with different drone models</p>

                    <p>Our prototype and use case will be presented in T-Mobile Tech Experience Center as a part of the 5G showcase.</p>

                    <h4>How do drones work in SAR and what’re their limitations?</h4>
                    <p>New technologies such as drones expand search and rescue (SAR)’s ability to locate people, but there are some limitations. We conducted 15 interviews with SAR team members and rescuees who have been rescued before to understand the workflow and dig out pain points.
                        <br><mark>These three pain points were mentioned over and over again by SAR teams in the interviews and we organized them. </mark></p>
                    <img class="my-3" src="res/Dronected/problem.png">
                    <li style="color:#ED1C24"><p style="color: #202020;">Spotting a person on a tiny screen mounted on the controller is very difficult, not to mention controlling the drone at the same time.</p></li>
                    <li style="color:#FCB040"><p style="color: #202020;">Advanced functionality on the drone is expensive for most search and rescue organizations.</p></li>
                    <li style="color:#784683"><p style="color: #202020;">Radio communication with drones can be choppy with the rough terrain present in many search and rescue scenarios.</p></li>
                    <p class="my-5"><mark>So how can we present a reasonably priced drone product to increase the effectiveness of spotting subjects without radio limitation?</mark></p>

                    <h3>PRIORITISATION  </h3>
                    <h4>From requirements to features</h4>
                    <p>We ideated possible solutions to solve this problem, like radio relay, cellular connection and 2-way voice communication. Given our time limitations, how can we put our effort into the most valuable area?</p>
                    <p><mark>In order to prioritize our features, we made a 3-axis matrix and picked the features that are most useful for SAR andT-Mobile which we are  able to develop.</mark></p>

                    <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                    <h4>A collaborative workflow with cloud-based AI to add on the drone</h4>
                    <p>By connecting drones to the cellular network, data is no longer limited in small area. <mark>That means other remote pilots, or even algorithms can review the video data and find insights to boost the efficiency of search.</mark> In addition, cellular networks will be less likely to be blocked by terrains like hills and <mark>make beyond-line-of-sight missions possible.</mark>

                    <h5 class="mb-2 mt-5">Results</h5>
                    <p><li><p><mark>Our prototype is able to prove the concept in the test level,</mark> but needs to improve the functionality to reach the work level.</li>
                        Evidence: One SAR team member: “I’d give your product A+ rate”; On-site pilots think our project is a neat idea and they can foresee the use case in SAR team, but there still some bugs to fix.<br></p>
                    <li><p><mark>It’s necessary to split control and monitor tasks for two different people,</mark> which validates our idea. Frustration of poor communication between the work mate is the main task load of pilot+observer mode, which means we need to improve on the usability.</li>
                    Evidence: “It’s hard to concentrate on keep spotting people for more than30 minutes”  and All on-site pilots and remote co-pilots have over 60 on mental load in NASA-TLX(0-100 scale)<br></p>
                        <li><p><mark>We need to provide the option to downgrade the resolution for less lag because 7 out of 8 participants (pilots and observers) complain about the latency of the video.</mark> And one collaboration test failed because of the video feed. In addition, we can try to offload video encoding from the Pi and/or have settings for lower resolution.</p>
                    <h3>FURTHER REFINEMENT </h3>
                    <h4>More efficient information display, adapt to on-site pilot, and better management</h4>
                    <h5 class="mb-2 mt-5">Add the mission management panel                    </h5>
                    <p>I added a mission management panel for pilots to receive missions, get mission updates before joining. Also, the panel provides data insights for managers to better understand the effect of drones.  </p>

                <h5>Refine the operation window more focused and more suitable for SAR teams</h5>
                <p>According to SAR teams’ feedback, I changed the layout of essential information and added more flight information so that co-pilots can immediately understand the status of drones even though they are not in the spot. The new layout also utilizes more space to display the most important streaming video.</p>

                <h5>Dedicated mobile interface for on-site pilots</h5>
                <p>We found in our test that pilots don’t sit in one place to control the drone. Instead, they walk around to observe drones from different angles. Thus, we made a phone support to attach the mobile phone on the drone controller. In addition, I refined the mobile interface for pilots to adapt to different interaction methods.                </p>

                <p>1. Focus on the minimum viable product. It's vital to get the first workable version to test with users so that I will have a clearer image of how users use the product.​
               
                <br>2. Involving engineers in the design process will help the team be on the same page and bring their perspectives. I invited engineers to participate in interviews, discuss evaluation plans, observe evaluations and analyze research results. They can get the striking and fresh information directly from users and feel the ownership of the research results. I don’t need to spend more effort in convincing them to adopt my ideas.
             
                <br>3. Always research and evaluation while design and development. Whenever we have some uncertain areas or challenges, we will seek out help, either consulting with experts or validating with users. As designers or developers, we always try to defend our work, so it’s necessary to test it with real users. </p>
