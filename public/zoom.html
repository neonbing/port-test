                    <p>Now people have virtual meetings in their daily lives almost everyday. If they don’t have the tool to manage their time, they will easily lose track of events. Zoom is a popular tool to arrange video conferences but it does a poor job in scheduling meetings and tracking meetings. Users have to rely on third-party services, which causes inconvenience, inconsistency and mistakes. Thus, we decided to redesign the schedule related functions on zoom.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5" style="font-weight: 700;">FOCUS</h3>
                    <h4>Upgrade for frequent use organization members</h4>
                    <p>The target users of zoom range widely, but for now, we want to focus on enterprise members who use zoom as collaboration tools frequently. The rationale behind the choice are:
                        <br>1. From a business perspective, zoom aims to expand the scale of enterprise users with more than 50 people according to their 20Q? financial report. Thus, improving the user experience for corporation users is one of the priority
                        <br>2. The core functions for modern remote work collaboration tools include email, instant messaging, calendar, collaborative document and video/call. If zoom wants to expand its function, calendar is the next reasonable step. </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5" style="font-weight: 700;">PRINCIPLES</h3>
                    <h4>Align with zoom original brand and users needs</h4>
                    <p>The redesigned zoom has to align with its original product advantages.</p>

                    <li><b>Efficiency</b> <br>Zoom focuses on efficiency in their product design. It has very limited steps before launching a meeting. Thus, our design will not add unnecessary tasks to the design.</li>
                    <li><b>Openness</b> <br>Zoom has its own unique advantages differentiated from others, which is access to people outside of the organizations and even without a zoom account. So we will keep that function in our redesign.</li>
                    <li><b>Professional</b><br>Zoom is designed for enterprise, so all design including visual, language, and interaction should all keep concise and professional.</li>

                    <h4>Tackle the pain point with a smarter design</h4>
                    <p>I analyzed the current user journey when users schedule a zoom meeting. There are three usability issues in the journey from scheduling the event to starting the meeting. </p>

                    <h4>From inconsistency to consistency</h5>
                    <p>Right now in zoom, If people need to schedule a meeting on zoom through a calendar system, they will be directed to either iCal or Google Calendar to finish the process. </p>
                    <img src="res/zoom/Insight-1-Cons.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>In our user research, users reflected that they were confused about the jump between different products. Even worse, if users need to update information like change time and they change through the calendar system, the information will be updated to the zoom app. The inconsistency leads to users’ confusion, dissatisfaction and wonder. </p>

                    <p class="caption justify-content-center d-flex"> Current zoom schedule event design</p>
                    <h5>Our solution</h5>
                    <p>Our solution is to leverage the existing contacts function in zoom, and let users invite colleagues within the organization all in the zoom system. To invite guests from external organizations, users either add them in contacts or type in their calendar and zoom system will send the email automatically.</p>

                    <h4>From inefficient manual operation to automatic process</h4>
                    <p>In our user research, still quite a lot of users choose to share links rather than schedule invitations. Under scenarios like that attendees are not limited or known to hosts, or that hosts meet using his personal room ID, hosts share the invitation link. Guests need to manually create an event on the calendar.                    </p>

                    <h5>Our solution</h5>
                    <p>Our solution to automate this process is add a direct add to calendar call to action in the jump page link. So that users simply click the link and add to zoom calendar and get all information.</p>

                    <h4>From inconvenience to all-in-one system</h4>
                    <p>The meetings list function in zoom doesn’t link with users’ email so only meetings people scheduled will show in the list. It’s not complete so even if people need to track events, they still need to turn to other calendars which is not conducive to developing users’ habits. The other problem of the list view is that it’s hard to have understanding of the time distribution of meetings.                    </p>

                    <h5>Our solution</h5>
                    <p>An embedded calendar will solve the problems. Besides that, two features mentioned below both require a calendar in zoom. Thus, we build the calendar in zoom to track zoom meetings and send out notifications to users. Users can track the events, receive any changes, start the meeting and indicate their availability to inform others, all in one page. </p>

                    <h4>To be continued</h4>
                    <p>The next step of the project is to let our target users try our prototype. Our main research questions are:
                        <li>How do users perceive waiting room links and is the adding to calendar from link intuitive to users?
                            <li>How intuitive does users invite internal users and people who are not in contact? What do users expect after they send or receive meeting invitations?
                                <li>How efficient do users find certain types of meetings on the Meeting page?
                                    <li>How difficult do users differentiate the event cards under different status?
                                        <li>What are the additional information that users may need to be presented on the card?
                        </p>
                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>Team design critique helps each other think more thoroughly of the design from different angles. It is helpful to explain the rationale behind my design decisions and throw proper questions to my teammate's design. It’s not about attacking others or defending myself, it’s more of digging into users' journeys and designing solutions together.</p>
